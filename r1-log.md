# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - Lars KÃ¼hn

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on 2020-02-02.

## Log

### R1D1 
Setting up the coding environment: Installed VS Code, git, cloned this repository.
Then thought of a first project, the birthdayreminder. For this, I want to use
python(3), so installed python-pip, npm, yeoman, then generator-flask-api, then SQLite.
Finally it doesn't work (flask.ext.script not found by python), and I am not happy with
yeoman using python2 instead of python3. 

This will be a next step: how to change the python version on my box.
Another next step should be a virtualization for coding.

### R1D2

Setting up the environment further did bring some problems. Why I insisted on removing
all those python packages from the system.

### R1D3

Tried to install the system and keep the home partition. I struggled with this nasty
UEFI situation on my laptop...

### R1D4

This afternoon I finally found a secret switch in the battery case of the device and now
the UEFI Secure boot installation finally worked. Only one hour more to recover the
crypted filesystem in my home dir - so now my machine is up and runnning.

It is time to find some more visual results.

### R1D5

Tired work after long day. I found a [complex tutorial for
Flask](https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world) and plan to use
it for my further steps.

#### Python learnings:
* virtualenv and activate it
* __name__ is the name of the module from where the other module is called
* __init__.py is the init file for a module. Here some things
  are defined, I will lern more
