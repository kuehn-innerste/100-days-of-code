### R1D1 
Setting up the coding environment: Installed VS Code, git, cloned this repository.
Then thought of a first project, the birthdayreminder. For this, I want to use
python(3), so installed python-pip, npm, yeoman, then generator-flask-api, then SQLite.
Finally it doesn't work (flask.ext.script not found by python), and I am not happy with
yeoman using python2 instead of python3. 

This will be a next step: how to change the python version on my box.
Another next step should be a virtualization for coding.
